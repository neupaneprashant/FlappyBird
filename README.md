# FlappyBird

Overview

Flappy Bird is a simple, addictive arcade game where you guide a small bird through a series of pipes. The objective is to navigate the bird between the pipes without touching them. Each successful pass through a pair of pipes earns you a point, and the game continues indefinitely, challenging you to achieve the highest score possible.

Features

Simple Controls: Tap the screen to make the bird flap and navigate through the pipes.
Endless Gameplay: The game continues as long as you keep flying through the pipes, with increasing difficulty.
High Score Tracking: Challenge yourself to beat your high score with each attempt.

Usage--
Once the game is running, click or tap the screen to make the bird flap. Your goal is to navigate the bird through as many pipes as possible without hitting them. The game is over when the bird collides with a pipe or the ground.
